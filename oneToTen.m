% In MATLAB, you create a vector by enclosing the elements in square brackets like so:
% 
%  x = [1 2 3 4]
% Commas are optional, so you can also type
% 
%  x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
% Create the vector
% 
%  x = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]
% There's a faster way to do it using MATLAB's colon notation.

function x = oneToTen
  x = [1:10];
end
