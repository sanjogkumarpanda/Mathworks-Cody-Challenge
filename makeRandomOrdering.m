% This is a basic MATLAB operation. It is for instructional purposes.
% If you want to get a random permutation of integers randperm will help.
% Given n, put the integers [1 2 3... N] in a random order.
% Yes, the test suite is not conclusive, but it is pretty close!

function ans = makeRandomOrdering(n)
  randperm(n);
